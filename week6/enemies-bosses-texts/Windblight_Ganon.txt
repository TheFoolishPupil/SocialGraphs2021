"Windblight Ganon is a recurring Boss in The Legend of Zelda series.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nHe is one of the four phantoms (known as the Blight Ganons) of Calamity Ganon that took control of the Divine Beasts. He is found either atop the Divine Beast Vah Medoh or in the center of Hyrule Castle if he is not already defeated. Windblight Ganon is responsible for the death of Revali.\nLink will need protection from the cold to resist cold damage during this fight. The battle with Windblight Ganon atop Medoh has two main phases. During his first phase, Windblight Ganon will fly and teleport around the area, shooting a gun at Link that fires powerful blue energy. Revali warns Link that his aim is spot on. He will also sometimes send a large tornado at Link. Link must shoot arrows at Windblight Ganon to inflict damage while he is in the air. Link can use one of the many air ducts in the area to glide up and shoot Windblight Ganon from the air. He will occasionally land on the ground where Link can use melee weapons on him. Once Link gets his health halfway down, the second phase will begin and Windblight Ganon will change his strategy. He sends four small objects into the air which charge blue energy between each other before shooting at Link. Link must avoid these attacks as well as Windblight Ganon's attacks. If Link manages to shoot one of the floating objects with an arrow, Windblight Ganon will fall and become temporarily disabled. If Link shoots Windblight Ganon with an arrow enough times in quick succession, he will fall to the ground and become stunned for a short period of time.\nOnce Link has defeated him, Windblight Ganon will explode and Link will be rewarded with a Heart Container.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nFireblight Ganon\nThunderblight Ganon\nWaterblight Ganon\n\n\n== References =="
