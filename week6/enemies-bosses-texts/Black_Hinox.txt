"Black Hinox are recurring Enemies and Sub-Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nBlack Hinox are the strongest versions of Hinox found in Breath of the Wild. They wear greaves on their legs, similar to Blue Hinox, but their metal composition makes Black Hinox vulnerable to electric attacks. Like all other Hinox, their eyes are weak to attacks. When defeated, they drop Hinox Toenails, Hinox Teeth, Hinox Guts, and a range of cooked meats.\nAs part of \"The Three Giant Brothers\" Shrine Quest, Link must retrieve an Ancient Orb from each of the three Hinox on Mount Taran, either by sneaking or by defeating them. The Oldest Kin is a Black Hinox, located in the Rabella Wetlands.\nAfter Link defeats Calamity Ganon and comples the \"Destroy Ganon\" Main Quest, Kilton will grant him the Medal of Honor: Hinox if he can defeat all of the Hinox in Hyrule, including Black Hinox.\n\n\n==== Locations ====\nTabahl Woods\nGiant's Forest\nLake Totori South\nHebra West Summit\nEast Gut Check Rock\nTempest Gulch\nMount Taran (Oldest Kin)\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nHinox\nBlue Hinox\nStalnox\n\n\n== References =="
