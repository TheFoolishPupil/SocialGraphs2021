"Blizzrobes are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nBlizzrobes are a variant of the Ice Wizzrobe. They attack by using their Blizzard Rods to dispel a huge freezing blast of air as well as by summoning frozen monsters such as Ice Chuchus and Ice Keese. They also cause blizzards to decrease the area's temperature, making it too cold for Link without cold-resistant Armor and Elixirs. Blizzrobes, like other Wizzrobes, will turn invisible after attacking, leaving ripples in the air with each footstep. Striking them in the head with an Arrow will stun them and give Link time to attack. Hitting it with a Fire attack, such as with a Fire Arrow or a Flameblade, will immediately evaporate the Wizzrobe. When defeated, Blizzrobes drop their Blizzard Rod.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nWizzrobe\nIce Wizzrobe\nThunder Wizzrobe\nMeteo Wizzrobe\n\n\n== References =="
