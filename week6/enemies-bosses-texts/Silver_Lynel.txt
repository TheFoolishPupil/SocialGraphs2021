"Silver Lynels are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nSilver Lynels are a variant of Lynel under the influence of Ganon's dark magic. Like other Lynels, it will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time after spotting Link, instead opting to stare down its opponent until they start their battle by roaring loudly and slamming their Weapon on the ground to cause a fiery explosion around itself. They carry the \"Savage\" Lynel set like the White-Maned Lynels, but their Weapons possess various bonuses. When defeated, Silver Lynels may drop Lynel Horns, Lynel Hoofs, Lynel Guts, Topaz, Rubies, Sapphire, Diamonds, and Star Fragments.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nBlack Lynel\nBlue-Maned Lynel\nGolden Lynel\nLynel\nMalice Lynel\nPurple Lynel\nWhite-Maned Lynel\n\n\n== References =="
