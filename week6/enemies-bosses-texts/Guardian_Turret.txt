"Guardian Turrets are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nGuardian Turrets are a type of Guardian that do not move, but instead fire powerful lasers at Link. They are only found around Hyrule Castle, in the Trial of the Sword, and in the Final Trial. Several Guardian Turrets guard the entrance to the Sanctum of Hyrule Castle, where Calamity Ganon resides. Most Guardian Turrets appear in their corrupted state, though one uncorrupted one can be found in Upland Zorana as part of the Main Quest \"EX Champion Mipha's Song\", which is exclusive to The Champions' Ballad DLC Pack.\nUpon spotting Link, their head will begin to elevate and they will charge their laser in preparation to shoot. Sometimes when firing their lasers, they will fire in rapid succession if their health is low enough and Link has not moved too far from when they fired their last laser. These rapid lasers will not damage Link, and will stop if Link gets hit, if Link is no longer within their range, or at a random stopping point. Some Guardian Turrets can lock Link between a wall and itself during this rapid shooting phase, and trap Link there for an extended period of time. If a Guardian Turret is hit from behind, they will malfunction similarly to a Decayed Guardian and start shooting lasers in whatever direction they were facing.\nIf Link hits a Guardian Turret in its eye using a Bow, it will temporarily stun it. Sometimes when doing this, the Guardian Turret may retract or extend its head in order to mess up Link's aim. Using Stasis + on a charging up Guardian Turret will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during Stasis +.\nIn Master Mode, Guardian Turrets will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off Link's timing.\n\n\n==== Drops ====\nA Guardian Turret drops between 5 and 8 of:\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn the Trial of the Sword, Guardian Turrets have the same music as the Decayed Guardians when Link encounters one.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nGuardian\nGuardian Stalker\nDecayed Guardian\nGuardian Scout\nGuardian Skywatcher\nSentry\n\n\n== References =="
