"Fire Wizzrobes are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed]\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Four Swords ===\nIn Four Swords, Fire Wizzrobes appear inside Vaati's Palace. They will vanish and appear in a random location and attack with a fire attack before vanishing again.\n\n\n=== The Minish Cap ===\n\nIn The Minish Cap, Fire Wizzrobes appear as a fiery variant to the green Wizzrobes and Ice Wizzrobes. Like the others, they will teleport to random locations throughout the area in which they appear, shooting their fire attack before vanishing again.\n\n\n=== A Link Between Worlds ===\nIn A Link Between Worlds, Fire Wizzrobes appear in Turtle Rock alongside their Ice variants. Like previous incarnations, they will randomly appear around the area and attack with a fire attack before vanishing again. Rushing to attack them as they appear will ensure their demise. Fire Wizzrobes also appear on the 24th floor of the Treacherous Tower's advanced level.\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nIn Breath of the Wild, Fire Wizzrobes can be found near ruins around Hyrule Kingdom. They attack by using their Fire Rods to conjure fireballs or by summoning flaming monsters such as Fire Chuchus and Fire Keese. They are also able to increase the area's temperature, making it too hot for Link without heat-resistant Armor or Elixirs. Fire Wizzrobes, like their other variants, will become invisible after attacking, leaving ripples in the air with each footstep. Striking their head with an Arrow will stun them, giving Link time to attack. Hitting a Fire Wizzrobe with an ice-based attack will immediately evaporate it. Upon defeat, it drops its Fire Rod.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Cadence of Hyrule ===\n\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nWizzrobe\nElectric Wizzrobe\nIce Wizzrobe\nThunder Wizzrobe\nMeteo Wizzrobe\nBlizzrobe\n\n\n== References =="
