"Azu is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAzu is a curious child who spends most of his time spying on the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab from a distance with his friend Sefaro. He has heard from Karin that a girl was seen around the Lab, but he is growing frustrated with the lack of evidence. Still, he is hoping to eventually catch sight of her. While Sefaro would like to go up to the Lab, Azu admits that his mother has told him not to get too close. During the rain, Azu claims that while he'd like to go visit the girl, he hates walking through the rain.\nIf Link stands between him and the Lab, he will quietly tell him that he is in the way. However, should Link show an interest in what he is doing, Azu will perk up and explain his actions. Link can apologize for getting in the way and Azu will be pleased. He will also happily tell Link that he and Sefaro are pretending to be spies.\nAt 8 o'clock, Azu decides it is time to stop playing and go home for the night. Even in his dreams, he wonders and mumbles about the \"super cute\" Sheikah girl.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nHateno Village\nHateno Ancient Tech Lab\nPruce\nIvee\nAmira\nSefaro\n\n\n== References =="
