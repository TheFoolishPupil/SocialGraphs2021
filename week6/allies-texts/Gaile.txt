"Gaile is a character in Breath of the Wild.[citation needed]\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGaile is a woman who works at the Foothill Stable. During the day, she is sweeping the outside of the Stable. At night, she can be found sitting in front of its Cooking Pot. When spoken to, she asks Link if he is planning on heading to Goron City. She becomes concerned when she sees that he is not dressed for the climate, and warns him that it gets so hot past the Region's second checkpoint that he will catch on fire. She decides that she likes Link enough to sell him Fireproof Elixirs that will protect him from the hot climate, and recommends that he buy at least three. Gaile will sell one Elixir for 60 Rupees, two for 110 Rupees, and three for 150 Rupees.\n\n\n=== Wares and Pricing ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== References =="
