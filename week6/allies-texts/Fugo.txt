"Fugo is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFugo is a Goron who lives in Goron City. He can be found outside of the blacksmith Rohan's house. Fugo is training under Rohan as his apprentice so that he may one day be his successor.\nAs part of his training, Fugo was assigned by Rohan to defeat every Igneo Talus around Goron City. He later explains that Rohan fought every Igneo Talus to grow stronger when he was young, and hopes to also reach that same goal. However, Fugo laments that he cannot get to the Igneo Talus at Darunia Lake, and openly wishes that someone else could go in his stead, which starts \"The Road to Respect\" Side Quest. Upon defeating the Igneo Talus and returning to Fugo, he is surprised to learn that Link defeated the monster. Fugo then decides to offer Link 100 Rupees in exchange for the achievement, and gives him a Silver Rupee in return. Fugo eagerly plans to tell Rohan about his false success. However, he cannot work up the courage to tell him nor confide his secret.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== References =="
