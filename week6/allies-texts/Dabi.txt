When spoken to at the front of the stable, he'll welcome Link and ask if he wants to register or take out a Horse. When Link takes a Horse out, Dabi thanks him for choosing their Stable.\nIf Link asks to register a horse without one present, Dabi will call him a comedian, saying to \"quit horsing around\" and to find a horse.

Once the Horse has been registered, he asks if Link wants to board it or take it with him.\nWhen attempting to register a Deer or Bear, Dabi will scold Link and say they only register Horses. Dabi insists that Stalhorses are monsters, and he won't board it in fear of it eating the other Horses.

He also tells Link that, if he's separated from his horse, whistling will cause it to come running.\nInside the stable, he will once again welcome Link and ask if he'll be staying with them. He offers regular beds for 20 Rupees and a soft bed for 40 Rupees. When asked, he explains that it's a special bed offered by the Stable, and anyone who uses it will wake up feeling more energized.\nBefore Link rests, Dabi tells him to sleep well.
