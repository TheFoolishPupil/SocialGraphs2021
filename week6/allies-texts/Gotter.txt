"Gotter is a character in Breath of the Wild.[citation needed]\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGotter is a beautiful man who resides at the Riverside Stable. Though Gotter works the Stable, he dreams about consuming a Recipe once favored by the Royal Family. When Link speaks with Gotter, the latter will tell him that the Riverside Stable's Inn is exemplary for its beauty. Afterwards, Gotter will recommend that Link visit the Millennio Sandbar, noting its pleasant environment. He will also compliment Link's appearance, claiming that he has beautiful features and asking the Hylian Champion to indulge in a request of his.\nIf Link agrees to hear his request, Gotter will praise his inner beauty and explain that his ancestor once worked as a chef at Hyrule Castle. Consequently, it is Gotter's dream to experience the decadent Recipes that the Royal Family of Hyrule once enjoyed. In order to fulfill this dream, Gotter asks Link to enter the Castle and search its Library for any remaining Recipes. This begins the Side Quest, \"A Royal Recipe\". Afterwards, Gotter will wait outside the Stable beside its Cooking Pot and muse to himself about delicious cuisine.\nThough it is not necessary to complete the Quest, if Link returns to Gotter after reading either Castle Library Book in Hyrule Castle, the beauty-obsessed Hylian will ask for Link to prepare it for him. Upon speaking to Gotter at any point after obtaining the Quest and regardless of whether he has read a Castle Library Book, Link can give Gotter a Fruitcake or Monster Cake. If Link gives Gotter a Fruitcake, Gotter will pause to muse that Zelda herself once enjoyed the same Recipe before eating it. Afterwards, Gotter will compare it to the adrenaline rush of being spotted by a Guardian. Alternatively, if Link gives Gotter a Monster Cake, Gotter will mention that the minister of Hyrule favored it before eating it. Gotter will then compare the experience to being struck by a Hinox.\nIn return for recreating either Recipe, Gotter will praise the Food and gift Link a Silver Rupee, valued at 100 Rupees. This completes Gotter's Quest. Afterwards, Gotter will mention that he would like to try any other Recipes that might be found in Hyrule Castle. If Link returns with the other cake after giving Gotter one, Gotter will ask Link to prepare it for him. If Link complies, Gotter will give Link a second Silver Rupee and then resolve to practice his culinary skills on any guests at the Riverside Stable's Inn. At night, Gotter will walk inside the Stable to rest and compare the number of Recipes to the ostensibly endless horizon of Hyrule.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nA Royal Recipe\n\n\n== References =="
