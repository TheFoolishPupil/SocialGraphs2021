When he was a child, he was the leader of the Big Bad Bazz Brigade, which included himself, Rivan, Gaddison, and Link. Link taught Bazz swordsmanship when he was young.\nWhile Bazz does find Link to be familiar at first, he has trouble placing where they've met before. When he does finally recognize Link, he decides to test him with the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password to make sure he's correct. He starts with, \"Fluffy white clouds! Clear blue...\" After Link successfully guesses the word \"Zora\", Bazz will be convinced that the person he's speaking to is Link. He asks Link what he's been doing for the past 100 years, but doesn't believe Link when he reveals he was sleeping.\nAfter the Divine Beast Vah Ruta\" Main Quest has been completed, he thanks Link for doing so.
