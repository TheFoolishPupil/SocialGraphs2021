"Cara is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCara is a Gerudo who, alongside Isha, owns the Starlight Memories Jewelry Shop in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to Cara, she apologizes and says that the Shop is not open right now. She goes on to explain that with the Divine Beast Vah Naboris around and the theft of the Thunder Helm, Gerudo Town has been facing many problems lately. \nAfter Link completes the \"Tools of the Trade\" Side Quest, Cara will tell him secrets about Isha as thanks. One secret is the fact that Isha's name is actually \"Jewel\", but she thought it was embarrassing to be a jeweler named Jewel. However, Cara thinks it's a fine name. She's also heard that Isha sleeps wearing nothing but accessories and wonders whether she gets cold.\nCara also shares that, despite Isha's claims that she doesn't do anything special with her looks, she visits the Hotel Oasis once a week. She reminds Link that people who make such claims are usually lying. She also describes Isha's past love triangle with Ashai, noting that both are still single.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nGerudo\nStarlight Memories\nIsha\n\n\n== References =="
