"Estan is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEstan is a Gerudo who manages a General Store in Gerudo Town. She sells a variety of cooked meat. According to Maike, a merchant at the Kara Kara Bazaar, she is Estan's big sister. Maike tells Link that Estan knows the Hylian Language well, recommending that he stop by and meet her. If Link speaks to Estan, she greets him and asks him what he eats for breakfast, lunch or dinner depending on the time. If Link says that he eats meat, Estan comments that he has good taste. If Link says that he eats vegetables, she insists that he must have meant meat. Estan tells Link that she once traversed across Hyrule in search for the best meats and learned common words in the Hylian Language during her travels. Although Estan knows some words in the Hylian Language, she usually mispronounces them, such as saying \"tank you\" instead of \"thank you.\" Estan wonders if Frita, the Rito girl who stands near her Shop, has something against meat and mutters that it is impossible.\n\n\n=== Wares and Pricing ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== References =="
