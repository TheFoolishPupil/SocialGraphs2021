"Furosa is a character in Breath of the Wild.[citation needed]\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFurosa is a Gerudo who manages The Noble Canteen in Gerudo Town. If Link speaks to Furosa, she greets him and is surprised to see a \"Hylian vai.\" Furosa comments that Link seems too young to come to her Canteen and explains that they mix special drinks for adults there. If Link asks about the special drinks, Furosa explains that they make the drinks with the ice from the Northern Icehouse. If Link asks for drink recommendations, Furosa tells Link about their featured cocktail, the Noble Pursuit. Furosa describes her Noble Pursuit as a light, sweet and cool sensation and that it is like drinking \"distilled motivation.\" If Link asks if they serve Milk in reference to the Milk Bar from past Zelda games, Furosa is appalled by the idea of serving something so childish. She then complains, thinking that Greta sent Link to say that as a prank and criticizes the Gerudo Secret Club for only drawing young people's attention. When Link ends the conversation, Furosa comments that she has not seen Pokki in a while, explaining that Pokki used to come to the Canteen every day to drink Noble Pursuit. Furosa cuts herself off and apologizes after realizing that there is no reason to talk to Link about this.\nDuring the Shrine Quest, \"The Perfect Drink\", Link tries to order a Noble Pursuit from Furosa. However, she needs a huge amount of ice to make the drink and she is all out. After Link informs her that Pokki has collapsed, she instructs Link to get ice for her from the Northern Icehouse. Upon arriving to the Northern Icehouse, Link quickly gets permission from Anche to take some ice. Link must now carry the ice to Furosa, who is waiting for Link past the ruins south of the Icehouse. Once Link successfully makes it to Furosa with the ice, she tells him that she may be able to make the best Noble Pursuit she has ever made with this ice. She then tells Link to go let Pokki know that the \"best drink ever\" is waiting for her.\nIf Link talks to Anche afterward, she will ask him to deliver more ice to Furosa for her. Anche charges Link 50 Rupees for the ice and explains that Furosa will reimburse him. Link is timed while delivering the ice and if he delivers it in a short amount of time, such as under 2 minutes, Furosa will be shocked with his time and reward him with a Gold Rupee. Furosa also states that Anche must be happy and asks him if he wants to deliver more ice.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== References =="
