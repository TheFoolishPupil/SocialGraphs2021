"Fire-Breath Lizalfos are recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.[name reference needed] They are visually distinct from other types of Lizalfos due to their red and orange coloration. Incarnations of normal, green-colored Lizalfos from previous Zelda games can breathe fire, but in Breath of the Wild, only this variety can do so.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nFire-Breath Lizalfos are one of the elemental variants of the Lizalfos race. With all the agility of its species, this particular creature can breathe a stream of fire and will follow Link as he tries to move away from the flames. Hitting it with an ice attack will instantly kill it. They're commonly found in volcanic areas around the Eldin Region and, unlike other monsters, they can survive and swim in molten lava. If they're defeated in while in lava, their dropped items will be instantly incinerated and Link will not be able to collect them.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nIce-Breath Lizalfos\nElectric Lizalfos\nBlue Lizalfos\nBlack Lizalfos\nSilver Lizalfos\nGolden Lizalfos\n\n\n== References =="
