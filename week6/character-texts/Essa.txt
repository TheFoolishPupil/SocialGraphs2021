"Essa is a character in Breath of the Wild.[citation needed]\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEssa is a Gerudo who works for Frelly at the Sand-Seal Rental Shop Southeast Booth. When Link speaks to Essa, she tells him that all of the Sand Seals there were trained by Frelly, making them faster and preventing them from abandoning the rider. She feels that it is worth renting a trained Sand Seal and that Frelly puts her heart into training them. Essa also says that Frelly trained the Sand Seals that are used in the Sand-Seal Races. If Link asks about Sand-Seal Races, Essa explains that Sand-Seal Racing is a Gerudo tradition where people race around a course with a Sand Seal to see who is the fastest. She tells Link to exit the southeast gate of Gerudo Town and head to the right to find the Sand-Seal Rally. Essa feels that Frelly has been talking strangely lately and wonders why.\nIn The Champions' Ballad DLC Pack, Link can find Essa to the northwest of Gerudo Town with a group of wild Sand Seals. Essa explains that Frelly asked her to go recruit some wild Sand Seals. While the Sand Seals in town are faster and will wait for the rider, Essa's wild Sand Seals will run away when dismounted. She recommends renting a trained one. Link must use a Sand Seal at this location to race through a series of blue rings across the Gerudo Desert as part of the Main Quest, \"EX Champion Urbosa's Song\".\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== References =="
