"Stone Taluses (Luminous) are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nStone Taluses (Luminous) are variations of Stone Taluses, with the notable difference that the Ore Deposit on their body is instead a Luminous Stone Deposit. Like all Taluses, the only way to damage a Stone Talus (Luminous) is to strike its Ore Deposit with a weapon. They're particularly vulnerable to Iron Sledgehammers and other mining tools as well as Bomb Arrows.\nThe Medal of Honor: Talus can be obtained from Kilton by defeating all Stone Taluses (Luminous) as well as all other variations of Talus in Hyrule Kingdom. This can only be done after defeating Calamity Ganon and completing the \"Destroy Ganon\" Main Quest.\n\n\n==== Locations ====\nMapla Point\nLake Hylia North\nLake Kolomo\nChampion's Gate North\nSouth Koukot Plateau\nMount Nabooru\nSouth Taafei Hill\nEast Mount Granajh\nUpland Lindor\nSouthern Tal Tal Peak\nCrenel Hills\nRutimala Hill\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nLuminous Stone Deposit\nStone Talus\nStone Talus (Rare)\n\n\n== References =="
