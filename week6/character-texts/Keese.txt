"Keese are recurring Enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nKeese are bat-like creatures that inhabit Dungeons and Caves, similarly to their real-life counterparts. Following their debut in The Legend of Zelda, they have since become a staple of The Legend of Zelda series and have appeared in the majority of games with the exception of The Adventure of Link, where Keese are absent and are instead replaced by the similar Aches.\nKeese often exist in clusters in the places where they are found. They fly around the screen erratically, not heading towards anything in particular, and stop to rest for a short amount of time on a neighboring wall or rock face. In some games, such as A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, Keese move about the screen only when Link is within close proximity, otherwise they remain still. Later games, such as The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, introduce Keese with a slightly more active attack strategy, targeting Link, but pausing above him before striking, providing an opportunity for him to strike.\nAs small and commonplace creatures, Keese are relatively weak and can be dispatched with a variety of weaponry, from Swords and Boomerangs to Arrows and Bombs.\nKeese are known to inhabit various forms in adapting to their surrounding environment. Notable variants include Fire Keese and Ice Keese, which are enveloped in fiery and icy mist, respectively. Less common forms include Keese Swarms, Shadow Keese, Electric Keese and Dark Keese. Vires, when defeated, will also split into a pair of Keese, which may or may not be fought.\n\n\n=== The Legend of Zelda ===\n\nKeese inhabit Dungeons in The Legend of Zelda. They resemble blue bats, and commonly appear in small to medium-sized groups. Keese flutter through rooms in a random path, stopping only periodically to rest. They are also the only enemies that are encountered in the game's side-scrolling chambers, where they can be found resting against the walls before taking flight. Keese can be defeated by any weapon in Link's arsenal, including the Sword, Bow and Candle. As they are very small enemies, the Boomerang will also defeat them as opposed to stunning them. Vires will split into two red Keese when defeated. These Keese are fought in the same manner as the common variety. Keese never drop any items when defeated.\n\n\n=== A Link to the Past ===\n\nKeese inhabit Caves and tunnels in the Light World of Hyrule in A Link to the Past. Unlike their previous incarnation, Keese remain still along Cave walls and crevices, but take flight when Link draws close. Keese in A Link to the Past have a more direct flight pattern than previous appearances, soaring in a curving arc as opposed to random flight, before resting again on the next wall. They are also encountered less frequently in groups, though they can still occasionally be found huddled together. They are weak enemies and can be defeated by any means of attack. In the Game Boy Advance version of A Link to the Past, Keese also appear as enemies in the Palace of the Four Sword.\nThe Dark World counterparts of Keese are Chasupa, which behave identically but are significantly stronger.\n\n\n=== Link's Awakening ===\nKeese often appear in small groups in Caves and Dungeons in Link's Awakening. They remain still until Link approaches, whereupon they take to the air and fly in a curving arc before briefly stopping to rest. They are much smaller than past appearances, and their darker coloration provides camoflauge against pits and makes them difficult to see. Despite this, Keese are still weak enemies and can be defeated by any attack.\nBattle Bats are a similar enemy summoned by the Grim Creeper, and are also referred to as Keese. When Vires are defeated, they will turn into a pair of Keese with skull faces, attempting to dive at Link before flying away.\n\n\n=== Ocarina of Time ===\n\nKeese are much more active than their previous appearances in Ocarina of Time; most fly around rooms without ever stopping to rest. They can occasionally be found huddled against walls, but take flight when disturbed. Keese are also much more aggressive, and will attempt to dive at Link whenever they spot him. Their attacks can be blocked by holding up the Shield. Keese can be defeated with any conventional weapon; however, due to the 3D environment and their high-altitude flight, Link may have to resort to using ranged weapons such as the Fairy Slingshot, Boomerang, Fairy Bow or Hookshot to reach these enemies. Yet as many are constantly in flight, they can be difficult to aim at without Targeting. Keese in Ocarina of Time do not inhabit Caves, and are instead only encountered in Dungeons, especially within dark corridors.\nOcarina of Time also introduces two variations: Fire Keese and Ice Keese. They are Keese that are enveloped in fiery and icy mist, respectively. Fire and Ice Keese can transform into normal Keese and vice versa; they can have their flames or mists extinguished by blocking their attacks with the Shield, while a standard Keese can become a Fire or Ice Keese if they fly into fire or Blue Fire, respectively.\n\n\n=== Majora's Mask ===\n\nIn Majora's Mask, Keese appear identically as their Ocarina of Time incarnations in Majora's Mask. They fly through the space they inhabit, and dive at Link whenever they spot him. Long-range weapons, such as the Boomerang, the Hero's Bow, and the Hookshot, are effective against them. They can only be found in a few areas, including Beneath the Well and the Stone Tower Temple.\nFire and Ice Keese reappear in Majora's Mask, identically to those from Ocarina of Time. Majora's Mask also introduces similar enemies called Bad Bats. These enemies behave similarly to Keese, but are much larger in size.\n\n\n=== Oracle of Seasons ===\nKeese closely resemble their Link's Awakening incarnation in Oracle of Seasons, appearing as small, dark-colored bats. They inhabit caverns and Dungeons in large groups. Keese are easily disturbed, and will fly sporadically around their space. Like those from Link's Awakening, their small size and dark coloration can make them difficult to see, especially over dark pits or against the walls of side-scrolling areas. They can be defeated by any means of attack.\nFire Keese also appear in Oracle of Seasons. Fire Keese whose flames have been extinguished will revert back into ordinary Keese, though they retain their original flight pattern and can fly through fire to turn back into Fire Keese.\nVire will turn into a pair of Keese with skull faces when it is defeated.\n\n\n=== Oracle of Ages ===\nKeese closely resemble their Link's Awakening incarnation in Oracle of Ages, appearing as small, dark-colored bats. They inhabit caverns and Dungeons in large groups. Keese are easily disturbed, and will fly sporadically around their space. Like those from Link's Awakening, their small size and dark coloration can make them difficult to see, especially over dark pits or against the walls of side-scrolling areas. They can be defeated by any means of attack.\nFire Keese also appear in Oracle of Ages. Fire Keese whose flames have been extinguished will revert back into ordinary Keese, though they retain their original flight pattern and can fly through fire to turn back into Fire Keese.\nVire will turn into a pair of Keese with skull faces when it is defeated.\n\n\n=== Four Swords ===\n\n\n=== The Wind Waker ===\n\nKeese appear in Caves and Dungeons in The Wind Waker. They constantly fly around the areas they inhabit, and will fly over to Link when they notice him. Their attack strategy differs slightly from previous appearances, and they will pause just before striking Link. Any conventional weapons are effective against them, with long-ranged weapons, such as the Boomerang, the Hero's Bow, and the Hookshot, necessary to engage them from a distance.\nFire Keese also appear in The Wind Waker. They can be turned into normal Keese by blowing out their flames with the Deku Leaf.\n\n\n=== Four Swords Adventures ===\nKeese in Four Swords Adventures are based on those from A Link to the Past. They initially sit still, but fly in a curving path as they are approached by the Links. They can be found inside caverns and Dungeons. Unlike other appearances, Keese in Four Swords Adventures often appear alone or secluded from one another. They can be defeated with a single strike from the Sword.\nFour Swords Adventures also introduces a variant called a Keese Swarm. These enemies surround the Links in a trail of copies, and can only be defeated by striking the Swarm's red Keese.\n\n\n=== The Minish Cap ===\n\nKeese in The Minish Cap appear and behave similarly to those from Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. They are small enemies that are easily disturbed and flap about rooms in an unpredictable pattern, stopping only periodically to rest. Unlike other appearances, they have no way to camouflage themselves, and they inhabit Caves and Dungeons across Hyrule. Any conventional weapon can defeat them.\n\n\n=== Twilight Princess ===\nKeese in Twilight Princess more closely resemble real-world bats, but with ghastly features and tattered wings, as well as the addition of a curved hook on their tails. These enemies are constantly in flight as they patrol the space they occupy. Similarly to those of The Wind Waker, Keese fly at Link and pause before striking, giving him an opportunity to attack before they do. As small and lightweight enemies, any weapon in Link's arsenal is able to defeat them.\nFire and Ice Keese reappear in Twilight Princess. The Gale Boomerang can be used to extinguish their flames and icy mist, turning them back into normal Keese. Shadow Keese are a Twilight version that only appear in the Twilight Realm.\n\n\n=== Phantom Hourglass ===\nKeese in Phantom Hourglass are common enemies that inhabit Caves and Dungeons. Closer to their 3D console appearances, they are constantly in flight and fly in circular, random motions, and often appear in small groups. These enemies can be easily defeated merely by striking them with the Sword, though many other weapons are also effective at dispatching them.\nFire and Ice Keese reappear in Phantom Hourglass.\n\n\n=== Spirit Tracks ===\nKeese in Spirit Tracks are common enemies that inhabit Caves and Dungeons. Closer to their 3D console appearances, they are constantly in flight and fly in circular, random motions, and often appear in small groups. These enemies can be easily defeated merely by striking them with the Sword, though many other weapons are also effective at dispatching them.\nFire and Ice Keese reappear in Spirit Tracks. The Whirlwind can be used to blow away their flames and mist, turning them into regular Keese.\n\n\n=== Skyward Sword ===\nFi's Comment:\nKeese in Skyward Sword patrol the areas they reside in while in flight high above. When they notice Link, they fly down to his level, and pause before attacking. Their distinctive yellow eyes will glow red just before they strike. Keese can defeated with simple Sword strikes, as well as shot down from the sky using long-range weapons such as the Slingshot, Beetle and Bow.\nSkyward Sword also features several other variations of Keese, including Fire Keese and two new forms: Thunder Keese and Dark Keese. Thunder Keese are an electrified variant, whereas Dark Keese are a skeletal variant that are able to Curse Link.\n\n\n=== A Link Between Worlds ===\nKeese in A Link Between Worlds are closely based on their A Link to the Past incarnation. They sit quietly, taking to the air only when approached. Keese will generally make for Link's direction as they fly. As before, any conventional weapon is able to dispel or otherwise stun them. If left alone, they will return to their original positions.\n\n\n=== Tri Force Heroes ===\nKeese in Tri Force Heroes behave similarly to their 3D console appearances. They patrol their territory in short, circular paths, yet when they spot one of the Links, they will back away before swiftly diving at them to attack. They can be defeated or stunned by any weapons in the Links' possession.\nFire and Ice Keese both appear in Tri Force Heroes. It is possible to use the Gust Jar to turn them into regular Keese.\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nKeese appear in Breath of the Wild as bat-like Enemies with sharp teeth and a single, glowing eye. They can potentially drop Keese Eyeballs or Keese Wings when defeated. Keese are found during nighttime, and sometimes on the roofs of Caves. They will often attack in swarms.\nElectric, Fire, and Ice Keese also reappear in Breath of the Wild. These drop Fire Keese Wings, Ice Keese Wings, and Electric Keese Wings, respectively, as well as Keese Eyeballs.\nWhen blown away using a Korok Leaf, Keese will momentarily fall to the ground before they start flying again.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Cadence of Hyrule ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nAche\nAcheman\nBad Bat\nChasupa\nDark Keese\nElectric Keese\nFire Keese\nIce Keese\nKeese Swarm\nShadow Keese\nVire\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="
