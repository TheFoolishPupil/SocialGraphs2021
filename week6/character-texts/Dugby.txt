"Dugby is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDugby is a Goron child who can be found at the Goron Hot Springs in the Eldin Canyon. During the day, he can found sitting in one of its Hot Springs. When he's sitting in the Spring, Duby's mouth is underwater, which gargles his words. If Link swings his weapon around Dugby, he will be yelled at for doing something dangerous. At night, he sleeps nearby.\nDugby competes with his grandfather, Grapp, to see who can stay in the Spring the longest. However, he's unable to do so, and decides to go to sleep and beat his grandfather another day.\nWhen Dugby is in the water, he'll tell Link about the treasure that he buried near the Bridge of Eldin, with the promise that Link can keep it if he finds it. However, because Dugby's mouth is submerged underwater when spoken to, his directions to the treasure come out as gurgles. This initiates the Side Quest \"Death Mountain's Secret\". If visited during the night, Dugby mutters clearer directions to the treasure in his sleep.\nThe treasure turns out to be a Drillshaft. Although amazed that Link found the treasure, Dugby is skeptic about it and checks the Weapon to determine if it is the same Drillshaft he buried, and confirms that it is the same one. True to his word, he lets Link keep the Drillshaft as a reward for finding it.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nGoron\nGoron Hot Springs\n\"Death Mountain's Secret\"\nGrapp\n\n\n== References =="
