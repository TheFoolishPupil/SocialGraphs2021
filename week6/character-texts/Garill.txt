"Garill is a character in Breath of the Wild.[citation needed]\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGarill can be found living underneath a tree at Fort Hateno in East Necluda. Each day, he goes to observe the ruins of Fort Hateno. When Link first encounters him, he mentions paying respects to the soldiers who lost their lives defending the Fort in the Great Calamity. He teaches Link about a Hylian Champion who fought alongside the soldiers during the Great Calamity, as well as a rumor that the Champion was mortally wounded and taken to be revitalized to fight again after a long slumber. He attributes his very existence to the sacrifices made at Fort Hateno and vows to pass this knowledge on.\nGarill fancies the idea that he would have fought alongside the Hylian Champion if he were present during the Great Calamity, and expresses wonder at the Champion's skill to have been capable of felling the Guardians attacking the Fort.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== References =="
