"Sentries are enemies in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nSentries are a type of flying Guardian, similar to Guardian Skywatchers, that only appear on Death Mountain during the \"Divine Beast Vah Rudania\" Main Quest. Rudania dispatches Sentries as Link and Yunobo approach Death Mountain to hinder them as they attempt to disable Rudania. Sentries use red searchlights along the path up the Mountain which, should Link or Yunobo be spotted, will cause Rudania to furiously unleash Magma Bombs at them.\nWhile Sentries have a high amount of health at 1000, they are extremely weak to Remote Bombs and are one of the few enemies that can be taken down with a single bomb.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nGuardian Skywatcher\n\n\n== References =="
