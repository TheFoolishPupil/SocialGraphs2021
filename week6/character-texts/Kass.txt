"Kass is a character of the Rito tribe in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKass is a minstrel who travels Hyrule and sings the legends of the areas he visits whilst accompanying himself on bandoneon. When Link first meets Kass he introduces himself as a wandering minstrel, with a love for song. He travels the lands learning songs passed down within each region of Hyrule. He will offer to play songs related to the area Link encounters him in, the lyrics of said songs containing clues on how to unlock nearby hidden secrets.\nWhen spoken to at the Rito Stable, he will confess that he is homesick, and wonders how his wife and children are doing back at Rito Village. Once Link solves the riddles in each of his songs, he returns to Rito Village, where he will remain by the flight platform next to Akh Va'quot Shrine. When visited at night, he will reveal that his teacher was a Sheikah poet who lived in Hyrule Castle before the Calamity struck and had an unrequited love for Princess Zelda. Kass will then play one final song which reveals that Link's near death was what finally unlocked Zelda's abilities. Afterwards, he tells Link that he is aware of his true identity as Zelda's appointed knight and asks him to reaffirm that he will help Zelda save Hyrule.[citation needed]\nAt each of the Stables he is encountered at, he will play a version of Epona's Song that harmonizes with the stable theme that normally plays.\n\n\n== Songs ==\n\n\n=== Hero Songs ===\n\n\n==== Untitled History of Calamity Ganon ====\nLocation: Any Stable\n\"The kingdom of Hyrule is a vast and storied land,\nOft grasped in the palm of a villainous hand.\nA dark force of destruction, many times undone,\nRises once again\u2013Ganon, the calamitous one.\nBut hope survives in Hyrule, for all is not lost,\nTwo brave souls protect it, no matter the cost.\nA goddess-blood princess and a fearless knight,\nThey appear in each age to fight the good fight.\nTheir battle with Ganon I've committed to song,\nTo keep it through time, no matter how long.\nNow begins the second verse, listen and you'll know,\nOf their battle with Ganon 10,000 years ago.\nThe kingdom of Hyrule was once a land of lasting peace /\nA culture of such strength and wit, that suffering did cease.\nBut Ganon lurked beneath the surface, strengthening its jaws /\nSo the ancient people of Hyrule set out to help the cause.\nTheir efforts bore fruit in an automated force,\nTo help avert Calamity by sealing it at its source.\nFour giant behemoths for which power never ceased,\nEach of these titans was called a \"Divine Beast.\"\nAnd free-willed machines that hunted down their prey /\nThese Guardians were built to last so they could join the fray.\nTo guide the beasts in battle, warriors were needed,\nSo four Champions were pledged to see Ganon defeated.\nDivine Beasts, Champions, princess, and knight,\nTheir plan to rout Ganon was looking airtight.\nAnd when Calamity Ganon reared its head, Hyrule rose against it /\nThe optimism of Hyrule all the more incensed it.\nGanon raged in its assault, boiling with hate,\nIt gnashed its teeth and thrashed about, but it was all too late.\nThe Guardians kept the heroes safe through every hour...\nThe Divine Beasts unleashed attacks that weakened Ganon's power.\nThe hero with the sealing sword struck the final blow,\nAnd the holy power of the princess sealed Ganon so.\nAnd that is the story of the brazen attack,\nOn Calamity Ganon 10,000 years back.\"\n\n\n==== Untitled Teacher's Song ====\nLocation: Rito Village\n\"An ancient hero, a Calamity appears,\nNow resurrected after 10,000 years.\nHer appointed knight gives his life,\nShields her figure, and pays the price.\nThe princess's love for her fallen knight awakens her power /\nAnd within the castle the Calamity is forced to cower.\nBut the knight survives!

Ultimate, done by Yoko Shimomura, who is most known for her compositions in the Kingdom Hearts and Mario & Luigi series.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nKass is potentially derived from cassowary, a type of large, flightless bird, though he largely resembles a Blue-and-yellow Macaw. \nThe name Kassh\u012bwa is a play on the Japanese word \"kashiwa\", which originally referred to a certain breed of chicken but is now used more widely in western Japan to refer to various kinds of poultry dishes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
