"Misko is a character in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMisko is a bandit of unknown gender who has left their treasure hidden across Hyrule. Link never meets or sees Misko and only learns about them through information about their treasure. When Link tries to talk to Prissen and Domidak at the Dueling Peaks Stable, they will be discussing a lead on Misko's treasure, before stopping when they notice Link. If Link persists on discussing the treasure, Domidak will confirm they are looking for Misko's treasure but will not tell Link about the lead for free. If Link pays the 100 Rupees that Domidak asks for, he will state a riddle. Domidak explains that Misko hid the location of the treasure using a riddle and mentions that the person he had heard the riddle from can eventually be linked to an underling of Misko. Learning the riddle begins the Side Quest \"Misko, the Great Bandit\".\nIf The Master Trials DLC is installed, Misko's EX Journal will appear in the Outpost Ruins. The journal was written by Misko to note down the locations of eight Treasure Chests containing priceless relics that they stole from Hyrule Castle. Obtaining the stolen relics is the goal of four Side Quests: \"EX Treasure: Ancient Mask\", \"EX Treasure: Fairy Clothes\", \"EX Treasure: Twilight Relic\", and \"EX Treasure: Phantasma\".\nIf The Champions' Ballad DLC is installed, Misko's EX Journal 2 will appear in the Deya Village Ruins. In the Journal, Misko wrote down clues to where they had hidden six Chests containing priceless relics that they had stolen from Hyrule Castle. Retrieving the relics that Misko stole is the goal of four Side Quests: \"EX Treasure: Merchant Hood\", \"EX Treasure: Garb of Winds\", \"EX Treasure: Usurper King\", and \"EX Treasure: Dark Armor\".\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nMisko's EX Journal\nMisko's EX Journal 2\nMisko, the Great Bandit\n\n\n== References =="
