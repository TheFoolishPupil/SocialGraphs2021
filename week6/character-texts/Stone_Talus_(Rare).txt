"Stone Taluses (Rare) are recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nStone Taluses (Rare) are a variation of Stone Taluses found primarily around Hyrule Field and Tabantha Frontier. The main difference between them is the Ore Deposit on their body instead being a Rare Ore Deposit, and as a result of this, they tend to drop rarer loot than other Stone Taluses. The only way to damage them is to attack the Rare Ore Deposit on their body, which are particularly vulnerable to Iron Sledgehammers, as well as other mining tools, and Bomb Arrows.\nAfter defeating Calamity Ganon, Link can obtain the Medal of Honor: Talus from Kilton. He can do so by defeating all Stone Taluses (Rare), as well as all other variations of Talus, in Hyrule Kingdom.\n\n\n==== Locations ====\nHyrule Castle West\nWest Vatorsa Snowfield\nIllumeni Plateau\nKolami Bridge South\nGisa Crater\nTabantha Hills\nHyrule Castle Underground\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== See Also ==\nRare Ore Deposit\nStone Talus\nStone Talus (Luminous)\n\n\n== References =="
