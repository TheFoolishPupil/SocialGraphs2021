"Yiga Blademasters are recurring enemies in the The Legend of Zelda series.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nYiga Blademasters are the elite soldiers of the Yiga Clan. They can be found patrolling the Yiga Clan Hideout, and if they spot Link in the hideout, they will close all doors and exits while calling in back up. After Master Kohga is defeated, they will also start appearing randomly to attack Link.\nYiga Blademasters attack with Windcleavers that send blasts of air at long distances. They can also create fissures that produce updrafts that Link can use to glide before a stone pillar emerges from them. A shot to the head with the Bow can stun Yiga Blademasters, opening them for attacks. When defeated, they flee while leaving behind their Windcleaver and Mighty Bananas. After defeating Master Kohga, Yiga Blademasters will randomly appear all around Hyrule attempting to assassinate Link.\nDuring the Side Quest, \"The Stolen Heirloom\", Link must defeat a Yiga Blademaster in order to retrieve the heirloom that grants access to the Lakna Rokee Shrine.\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ===\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nYiga Footsoldier\n\n\n== References =="
