"Hinox are recurring enemies and Sub-Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series. They are Cyclops-like ogres that have an affinity for Bombs, and commonly use them as weapons against Link. They typically appear as musclebound, light brown humanoids with a single eye and a ponytail. In most games, they are significantly weak to Bomb explosions.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== A Link to the Past ===\n\nHinox are found in the Dark World of Hyrule in A Link to the Past. They are common to most locations, particularly near the Bomb Shop, and have a seemingly endless supply of Bombs to throw at Link. They are very powerful and are able to cause a lot of damage to Link if they come into contact with him. Despite their slow movements, they are extremely dangerous to Link when he first enters the Dark World and should be treated with caution. Striking them with a Fighter's Sword will defeat them, but it takes many hits and puts Link in danger, so it is easier for Link to throw his own Bombs at them or strike them with his Bow from afar.\nDespite what the English game manual suggests, a Hinox's weak point is not usually its eye, unlike similar monsters with a prominent single eye, nor are they weak to their own Bombs; these are mistranslations of the original Japanese manual, which stated the phrase \"\u76ee\u306b\u306f\u76ee\u3092 (Me ni wa Me o)\", or in English, \"an eye for an eye\". The true weakness of a Hinox are Link's own Bombs, which can destroy them with a single hit.\nIn the secret ending of A Link to the Past & Four Swords, obtained after completing the Palace of the Four Sword, Hinox are shown passing Bombs to one another, and one appears on top of the Pyramid of Power playing with a Super Bomb.\n\n\n=== Link's Awakening ===\nHinox appear in certain dungeons of Koholint Island as mini-bosses in Link's Awakening. A yellow one first appears as the mini-boss of Bottle Grotto, and later a red and blue Hinox appear in Eagle's Tower and Turtle Rock, respectively. The blue Hinox of Turtle Rock is not the dungeon's \"true\" mini-boss, as it will respawn when Link leaves and later re-enters the room.\nThe Hinox are much larger than those in A Link to the Past. They attack Link by throwing Bombs at him, as well as charging at him to grab him. If grabbed, the Hinox will lift Link off the ground and throw him to the sides of the room, causing him damage and leaving him stunned. In the first and second battles, the boss rooms have cracked floors and holes, respectively. If Link is grabbed, the Hinox may throw Link down one of these holes, which will reset the battle and restore the Hinox to full health the next time Link enters their room. After being struck by Link's Sword, the Hinox will throw a Bomb in retaliation.\nAll three Hinox retain their weaknesses to Bombs, but now takes two explosions to destroy one. Once Link obtains the Magic Rod from Turtle Rock, he can make short work of them, like many other enemies in the game.\nA Stone Hinox appears as a mini-boss of the Color Dungeon in Link's Awakening DX. While similar in form to a Hinox, its behavior is quite different, and it drops boulders as opposed to throwing Bombs.\n\n\n=== Four Swords Adventures ===\nHinox appear in large numbers in the Death Mountain Foothills of Hyrule in Four Swords Adventures. They behave similarly to their previous incarnations but instead attack by throwing Boulders. They will also attack by attempting to grab one of the Links. If grabbed by one, it shakes the Link and makes him drop his Force Gems. Despite their lack of explosives, they are still weak to Bombs, so it is recommended that the Links find nearby Bomb Flowers to destroy them with. If defeated with the Four sword, they will leave behind a Big Green Force Gem. At some point in the Death Mountain Foothills, a Quake Medallion can also be found in a nearby cave, which can be used to turn them into weak Zols.\n\n\n=== Phantom Hourglass ===\nHinox can be found on Dee Ess Island and in the Goron Temple. They look significantly different to their previous incarnations; they are now blue and have a fuse-like ponytail, giving them a Bomb-like appearance. Their eyes are also more prominent on their featureless faces, surrounded by a gold eyelid. They attack by throwing punches and Bombs; if Link throws a Bomb at them, they will throw it back. Because these creatures cannot be attacked from the front with a Sword, it is better to use the Boomerang from behind or to shoot them in the eye with the Bow to stun them for a short time, opening them up for attack.\n\n\n=== A Link Between Worlds ===\nHinox appear throughout Lorule in A Link Between Worlds in a similar role to those in A Link to the Past, although their Bombs now do more damage and they no longer have a weakness to Link's Bombs. A variety also appears in Lorule's snowy Death Mountain, which wear coats and throw Snowballs. The Snowballs are not as damaging as the standard variety's Bombs, but Link will be frozen briefly if hit, leaving him open to physical attacks. Both varieties of Hinox will also charge at Link, causing a large amount of damage. They can withstand many hits before being defeated.\nA lone, friendly Hinox can also be found inside a cave behind a waterfall in eastern Lorule. It bribes Link with the offer of Rupees if he promises to leave it alone.\n\n\n=== Tri Force Heroes ===\nHinox appear in Tri Force Heroes. They typically appear as strong, uncommon enemies that are usually encountered as \"mini-bosses\" in certain Levels. They first appear in Blazing Trail, where the Links fight a group of them along with Fire Keese on an island surrounded by fire spouts. They later appear in the second Stage of the Fire Temple. One appears riding a Mine Cart and throws Bombs at the Links. The Links must fight it by picking up its Bombs and throwing them back into its Mine Cart. Alternately, the Links can also use Bomb Flowers growing nearby as well. After it is defeated, two more appear and must be defeated using the same method. Hinox also appear in the final Stage of The Lady's Lair.\nThree unique Hinox, the Hinox Brothers, appear as the mini-bosses of Hinox Mine and Bomb Storage. Two are fought in Hinox Mine, though initially the Links face one. The Links fight them on moving Mine Carts, and must throw their Bombs into their Carts. In Bomb Storage, the Links first fight two of the brothers, and use the Gust Jar to propel their Bombs into their balconies. After the pair is defeated, the Links then face the third brother, who throws much bigger Bombs while summoning Hardhat Beetles. As these Bombs are too heavy to use the Gust Jar on, one Link must supply the other two with smaller Bombs to continue the strategy.\n\n\n=== Breath of the Wild ===\n\nHinox appear as bosses found in different locations across Hyrule Kingdom in Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors:Age of Calamity, typically in a clearing, asleep. In this game, Hinox are found in red, blue, and black varieties, depending on strength. They are depicted as giant Bokoblin-like creatures with a single eye in their forehead, wearing a necklace strung with several pieces of equipment as decoration (and in some cases, orbs needed to open nearby Shrines); if Link sneaks up on them, he can steal the equipment from the necklace without being detected. They are the largest enemy to be found in the overworld. They spend most of their time sleeping, only engaging Link when woken. Once awake, they will use physical attacks such as swipes and punches and pull up nearby Trees in order to toss them at Link. If the hero climbs out of their reach, the lesser variants will throw small boulders at him, while Black Hinox use Bomb Barrels. Shooting an Arrow at the eye will result in the monster being stunned and open to attacks until it recovers. After their health drops to half, they will cover their eye to block further Arrow shots, however, there are still chances to hit it during some of their animations or by shooting while falling. Once defeated, they will drop Weapons (if they were not already stolen from their necklaces beforehand), Hinox Toenails, Hinox Teeth, and Hinox Guts. In addition, they will drop some variety of Food: reds drop fruits, blues drop fish, and blacks drop meat.\nBlue and Black Hinoxes wear crude greaves made from wood and metal (respectively) around their ankles to protect them from attack. However, this armor can be used against them with the correct elemental attacks- the wood armor can be set on fire to make them panic until it burns away, and the metal armor conducts electricity and will subsequently stun them if hit by lightning-based attacks. \nA skeletal variant called the Stalnox also can be found.\n\n\n==== Locations ====\n\n\n===== Red =====\nKamah Plateau\nWest Loshlo Harbor\nKincean Island\nPhalian Highlands\nTobio's Hollow\nMount Taran (Youngest Kin)\nPurifier Lake\n\n\n===== Blue =====\nJa'Abu Ridge\nTrotter's Downfall\nMount Taran (Middle Kin)\nHerin Lake\nTalus Plateau\nRalis Pond\nAldor Foothills\nThyphlo Ruins\nSouth Akkala Plains\nNorth Hyrule Castle\nWest Hyrule Plains\nSeres Scablands\nApplean Forest\nDigdogg Suspension Bridge\nEast Ranch Ruins\nEventide Island\n\n\n===== Black =====\nTabahl Woods\nGiant's Forest\nLake Totori South\nHebra West Summit\nEast Gut Check Rock\nTempest Gulch\nMount Taran (Oldest Kin)\n\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Cadence of Hyrule ===\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nAs well as being based on the mythical Cyclops, Hinox also share similarities with Japanese Oni. Their loincloths and upturned fangs in particular are similar to the traditional appearance of an Oni, and the red and blue colored Hinox in Link's Awakening may be a reference to the tradition of a red and blue Oni pair.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nBlack Hinox\nBlue Hinox\nElectric Hinox\nFire Hinox\nHinox the Elder\nHinox the Eldest\nIce Hinox\nLil' Hinox\nMalice Hinox\nPurple Hinox\nSnowball Hinox\nAvalaunch\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="
