"Decayed Guardians are enemies in Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nDecayed Guardians are decayed variations of the Guardian Stalkers that have long lost their mobility. They are found buried in the ground, unable to move due to having no legs. Decayed Guardians appear inactive until Link approaches it, when they light up and aim their laser sights at Link in preparation to fire. A massive amount of Decayed Guardians can be found in the Forgotten Temple and will simultaneously take aim at Link the moment he enters the temple. They are prone to malfunctioning after being attacked, firing off several lasers in rapid succession.\nIf Link performs a Perfect Guard with any Shield on its laser, it is instantly defeated. If Link hits a Decayed Guardian in its eye using a bow, it will temporarily stun it. Using Stasis + on a charging up Decayed Guardian will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during stasis.\nIn Master Mode, Decayed Guardians will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off Link's timing.\n\n\n=== Drops ===\nA Decayed Guardian drops between 4 and 6 of:\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See Also ==\nGuardian\nGuardian Stalker\nGuardian Scout\nGuardian Turret\nGuardian Skywatcher\nSentry\n\n\n== References =="
